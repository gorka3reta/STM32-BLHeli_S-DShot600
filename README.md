# STM32-BLHeli_S-DShot600
STM32 project to send arming sequence and throttle values to REV35 35A 30A BLheli_S 3-6S 4 in 1 Brushless motor controler using timer channels and DMA

This project has been checked in a STM32F407VGT06 development board but it should work for any STM32 microcontroller by adjusting some stuff (libraries, HAL functions...)
NOT READY YET TO USE
